By integrating hydrogels with varying cross-linking densities, this approach aims to create macroporous structures that promote cell infiltration while preserving the structural integrity of the matrix. Early results demonstrate improved cell infiltration and promising in vivo stability, suggesting the potential for these hydrogels to support comprehensive soft-tissue restoration and advance tissue engineering applications.</p>",

My work involved developing a novel blood-joint transwell system combining human umbilical vein endothelial cells, fibroblast-like synoviocytes, and articular chondrocytes to model joint space interactions. I investigated the effects of euglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions on cell viability, inflammation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, elucidating the impact of metabolic conditions on joint degeneration. These findings were presented in a poster at the <a href=\"assets/media/bmes_poster.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"styled-link\">Biomedical Engineering Society Annual Meeting</a> in October 2024.</p>"
