By analyzing the deification of kings like Naram-Sin, the religious reforms of Shulgi, and the propaganda within texts such as the Enuma Eliš, the paper highlights the evolution of religious control mechanisms. It examines how these tactics fostered loyalty, justified authority, and facilitated societal changes, ultimately shaping Mesopotamian civilization.",

By examining the role of trust in evaluating sources and methods, as well as the influence of personal Ways of Knowing like emotion and intuition, the essay argues that while trust often plays a key role in accepting external knowledge claims, it is not always required when knowledge is formed internally. The analysis concludes that trust is frequently, but not always, involved in the acceptance of knowledge claims.",
